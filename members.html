              <p>Wesley is currently a senior at Jericho High School and has always loved to create and build.
		      His natural curiosity has led him into the world of Raspberry Pi’s and Arduino sensors as he enjoys tinkering
		      with hardware. Through hackathons, Wesley fell in love with the community of makers and as a result,
		      worked passionately to bring this atmosphere to Long Island. Additionally, he enjoys the business side
		      of things as well and TeenHacks LI was the perfect combination of the two. Above all, Wesley constantly
		      strives to learn new things and meet more people every day.</p>

              <p>Eva is currently a senior at Bronx Science. She is a huge fan of STEM and art. These both matter to her because art
              provides her infinite possibilities in the imagination while STEM enables her to explore and practice these
              possibilities in the real-world setting. During her first Hackathon event ever - in TeenHacks LI, she was fascinated
              with how both were combined together and actualized something even bigger. Thus far, she hopes to engage more youths,
              especially beginners, to get involved in this community that she is truly passionate about. Meanwhile, she believes in
              STEM progress would be the key to making the world a better place for everyone.</p>

              <p>Austin George is a senior at Great Neck South High School, with a passion for creating. Through this, he has grown a
              strong interest in both art and computer science. Whether it be painting the school mural or coding games for his
              friends, he’d much rather be on the side of the creator than the consumer. Throughout his high school career, he has
              strived to share this enthusiasm with others by tutoring students at local coding classes and sharing his experiences
              with the people he meets at hackathons like TeenHacks LI. This year, as Director of Programming, he is seeking the
              prospect of working with a few major companies in the tech industry that would be willing to host workshops to improve
              the overall hacker experience.</p>

              <p>My name is Rachel Woo and I am currently a freshman at Great Neck South High School. I am very passionate about computer sciences as well as STEM. During my free time, I like to work on different coding projects, play field hockey and research more about new technological developments. Attending the past two hackathons has inspired me to spread the CS community and influence more people to become involved with new innovations that can impact our futures. I hope to encourage more students in all different grades to immerse themselves with STEM activities and, as a director, enhance the hackathon experience.</p>
