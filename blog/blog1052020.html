   <p> If you start seeing people in public with chunky glasses that look like they are monitoring you—don’t worry, that's just Facebook’s new research project: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TechAtFacebook/videos/2732431417037016/"> Project Aria</a> . Facebook is currently working on developing <a href="https://www.livescience.com/34843-augmented-reality.html"> augmented reality </a> <b> glasses </b> that work as efficiently as smartphones. To help develop this idea, the company is embarking on a <b> research project </b> with a glass prototype called Project Aria. </p>
  <p> So why AR glasses specifically? Facebook was originally deciding between a smart hat or bracelet, but ultimately chose glasses because “if you really want a system that is <b> socially aware in a sense </b>, it perceives the space like people do, you’ve got to look at it from a <b> human  point of view </b>”, says Renzo De Nardi, the Technical Lead at Project Aria. The glasses would help humans better by seeing the world as humans see them, especially with <b> navigation features </b>. It also has a camera and internet access. Currently, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0QVh5TJl3c"> prototype </a>  is <b> sensor-rich </b> and soaks up everything it hears and sees with <b> cameras facing in and out to see where your eyes are pointed </b>, coupled with an accelerometer to determine orientation. </p>
    <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/project-aria-facebook-ar-glasses-real-world-testing/"> <img class = "sideimg" src="blogimage/1052020s.png" alt="Snow"> </a>
  <p> However, before the glasses officially launch into the real world, a lot of <b> concerns about privacy </b> and Facebook’s policy model must be answered. As a result, Facebook is sending people part of their research team to go out in public and Facebook campuses to wear these glasses. This project, Project Aria, will help the glasses <b> map out the world </b> by taking pictures to see the environment in real world conditions, both indoor and outdoor. This project is similar to the <b> mapping car </b> that Google used when it was figuring out its street view feature of Google Maps.  </p>
  <p> But how creepy is it that some random employee at Facebook could take a picture of you? Well fortunately, Andrew Bosworth—head of Facebook’s Reality Labs—said that all Project Aria participants are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-project-aria-smart-glasses-cameras-employees-public-2020-9"> required to wear a Facebook research shirt </a> , and the glasses will have the words <b> “Research” </b> written with bold white letters. Additionally, all of the data collected will be reviewed and faces of people and license plates will be <b> blurred </b>. The main purpose is to <b> gather data </b>for AI training and AR perception systems, assess the public’s perception of the glasses, and to answer major questions about <b> privacy, ethical, and technical concerns </b>. With Project Aria, Facebook hopes that their technology will help users see the world in a new way as they release new prototypes of their cutting-edge AR glasses. </p>

               <figcaption class = "bby">By: Arpitha Vinod</figcaption>
              <FIGCAPTION class = "btext"> Is humming obnoxiously while unlocking your front door just as important as just having a lock for your front door? The answer is a definite yes- hackers can now break into your house just by hearing your key being placed inside of a lock. SpiKey is the name of this attack model where hackers can duplicate your key just by listening to the key being placed and turned inside of a lock. Everytime a person unlocks their front door with a physical key, the key produces a small sound.  If a hacker were able to record this sound, they would have all the information necessary

            <figcaption class = "bby">By: Arpitha Vinod</figcaption>
            <figcaption class = "btext" >  Unprecedented times call for unique answers to unprecedented problems. While TeenHacks LI can’t support an in-person 24 hour hackathon due to COVID-19, we are adapting to a new format: a triathlon, but for hackers! Have you ever participated in a triathlon? It involves three types  of races: swimming, cycling, and running. Our tri-hackathon is divided into three exciting parts as well: Learn-a-thon, Build-a-thon, and Share-a-thon! Though we can’t host hackers in person, we now have an opportunity to expand our work to three separate events—combining the best parts of a hackathon!
