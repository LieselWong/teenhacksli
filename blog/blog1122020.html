  <p> Have you ever looked up at the night sky and saw the bright white moon and wondered how life would be like there- no internet or phone, just you? Well dream all you want because in just <b> two </b> years, you will be able to <b> send a text all the way from the moon </b>. </p>
  <p> By 2028, NASA hopes to make humans living on the moon a real thing. As a step to achieve this plan set by <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/"> NASA's Artemis program  </a>, NASA has chosen to work with <b> Nokia </b> to build a <b> 4G network on the moon </b>. Nokia’s industrial research and scientific development company, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/"> Bell Labs </a>, was awarded a 14.1 million dollar grant from <b> NASA </b> for this project, and it is working with the spaceflight engineering company <a href="https://www.intuitivemachines.com/"> Intuitive Machines </a>to go about this riveting task. </p>
  <p> So why can’t astronauts just take a social media cleanse when in space? <b> Communication and reliable technology is critical </b>for the improvement of future lunar missions, and a <a href="https://www.fusionconnect.com/blog/blog-archive/what-is-4g-network/"> 4G network</a> is much <b> more stable </b> than the current <a href="https://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/Communications/zoom-messages.html#:~:text=Messages%20travel%20through%20space%20as,received%20and%20acting%20on%20it"> radio communication</a>in place. Astronauts can use the wireless connection to control lunar rovers, live-stream high quality videos, transmit data, make a call, text, and even navigate in real time (sort of like a Google Maps for the moon). Furthermore, 4G might work even better on the moon since there are no trees, tall buildings, or TV signals to block the connection. </p>
<a href="https://www.4g-lte.net/4g/lte-advanced-gigabit-4g-speeds/"> <img class = "sideimg" src="blogimage/1122020s.png" alt="Snow"> </a>
  <p> However, <b> there are some limitations </b> that Bell Labs is taking into consideration to adapt this network to the moon’s <b> different conditions </b>. For example, the network needs to be adapted to work well with the moon’s extreme temperatures, radiation, the space vacuum, as well as the extreme vibrations that occur on the surface during lunar landings and takeoffs. Nevertheless, NASA says, “The system could support lunar surface <b> communications at greater distances, increased speeds, and provide more reliability</b> than current standards.” </p>
  <p> While 4G on Earth is supported by huge cell towers and power generators, that might be too gigantic to fit inside a spaceship headed to the moon. As a result, Bell Labs is creating <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/5g/what-small-cell-technology"> small-cell technology</a> which is much more compact and uses less power than normal 4G. This same small-cell tech is used in 5G on earth, and is able to withstand the most extreme conditions. <b> By 2022 </b>, NASA and <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/var/articles/fly-my-network-moon/"> Nokia Bell Labs</a> are planning on <b> installing the network remotely through lunar hoppers </b>- a type of space vehicle. </p>
<p> As <b> space exploration </b> intensifies, it is intriguing to see how normal communication through texts can be achieved even on the moon. With the development of the 4G network, there is no telling how much astronauts can research and develop in the coming years. They say the sky's the limit, but now your calls can reach even further than that. </p>

               <figcaption class = "bby"> By: Arpitha Vinod</figcaption>
              <figcaption class = "btext"> What could be spookier than Halloween? That’s right—not following COVID-19 health guidelines during a global pandemic. While trick-or-treating has been the holiday’s main attraction in past years, this year is different. Many families hope to find safer alternatives which avoid large groups, close contact, and the distribution of candy (and germs along with it). One app in particular, Nextdoor, has risen to the occasion by providing neighborhoods with an interactive Halloween map.

            <figcaption class = "bby">By: Arpitha Vinod</figcaption>
            <figcaption class = "btext" >  Unprecedented times call for unique answers to unprecedented problems. While TeenHacks LI can’t support an in-person 24 hour hackathon due to COVID-19, we are adapting to a new format: a triathlon, but for hackers! Have you ever participated in a triathlon? It involves three types  of races: swimming, cycling, and running. Our tri-hackathon is divided into three exciting parts as well: Learn-a-thon, Build-a-thon, and Share-a-thon! Though we can’t host hackers in person, we now have an opportunity to expand our work to three separate events—combining the best parts of a hackathon!
