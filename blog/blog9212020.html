   <p> Is traffic ever so bad you just wished for teleportation powers so you don’t have to be late <i> again </i>? Well, here is a better alternative: <b> fly </b> your car to your desired destination! While that might seem like an innovation of the future, a Japanese tech company,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilrGhkavwyg"> Sky Drive Inc. </a>, recently <b> tested </b> a successful run of their manned flying car. </p>
      <p> Sky Drive was established in 2018 from the original volunteer group <a href="https://evtol.news/cartivator/"> Cartivator </a>, receiving most of its funding from the Development Bank of Japan. On August 25, the startup flew its current model: the SD-03—<b> the smallest electric vertical take off and landing (<a href="https://evtol.news/"> eVTOL </a>  ) machine. </b> Flying around the 2.5 acre <a href="https://evtol.news/"> Toyota Test Field </a> , the car lifted about 10 feet in the air for a whopping <b> four minutes </b>. While a one-manned pilot was in control of the vehicle, the pilot was also aided by a computer system to ensure safety. </p>
       <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/29/us/flying-car-successful-test-in-japan-trnd/index.html#:~:text=(CNN)%20A%20Japanese%20company%20has,drive%20of%20a%20flying%20car.&text=The%20SD%2D03%20is%20the,%22safety%20in%20emergency%20situations.%22"> <img class = "sideimg" src="blogimage/9212020s.png" alt="Snow"> </a>
      <p> The SD-03 takes the space of about <b>  two parked cars— </b>the aircraft/car is about 6.5 feet high and 13 feet in length and width. It has one seat, eight motors, multiple headlights and taillights, red lights on the bottom, and two propellers on each corner. While the prototype that was tested is a single seater, the company hopes to eventually make the vehicle have two seats in hopes of replicating an air taxi service. Analysts with Morgan Stanley, an investment banking company,  predict that urban air taxis could be a thing by 2040, with the <b> market increasing to approximately $2.9 trillion by then </b>. </p>
        <p> “We want to realize a society where flying cars are an <b> accessible and convenient </b> means of transportation in the skies and people are able to experience a safe, secure, and comfortable new way of life”, says CEO of Sky Drive, Tomohiro Fukuzawa. Other companies like Boeing and Airbus are also working on flying cars, but SkyDrive says that they intend on <b> launching the flying car commercially by 2023. </b> Of course, many more tests still need to be completed in order to ensure that the flying car meets safety and design standards. </p>
<p> While sky travel could very much be a thing in the coming years, there are still some issues to address. For instance, the vehicle needs to be strong enough to carry weight while still being able to fly at low altitudes. Also, the question of <b> energy efficiency </b>of this mode of transportation and the development of proper self autonomous technology must also be considered. So if you don’t have your driver’s license yet, don’t fret—you needn’t stress about doing your Drivers Ed test in the sky just yet.  </p>

              <FIGCAPTION class = "btext"> They say money can’t solve your problems, but Elon Musk, the fifth richest person in the world, says he will be able to  solve memory loss, depression, Parkinson’s disease, irrational fear, dementia, spinal cord injuries, and brain damage all with one tiny brain chip. Sound overly ambitious? Well, Musk’s company Neuralink is in its early stages of creating an implantable brain-machine interface--and early trial runs in pigs were successful. </FIGCAPTION>

            <h2 class = "btitle"> Announcing TeenHacks’ Tri-Hackathon</h2>
            <figcaption class = "bby">By: Arpitha Vinod</figcaption>
            <figcaption class = "btext" >  Unprecedented times call for unique answers to unprecedented problems. While TeenHacks LI can’t support an in-person 24 hour hackathon due to COVID-19, we are adapting to a new format: a triathlon, but for hackers! Have you ever participated in a triathlon? It involves three types  of races: swimming, cycling, and running. Our tri-hackathon is divided into three exciting parts as well: Learn-a-thon, Build-a-thon, and Share-a-thon! Though we can’t host hackers in person, we now have an opportunity to expand our work to three separate events—combining the best parts of a hackathon!
